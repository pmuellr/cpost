----------------------------------------------------
What you've got
----------------------------------------------------

You've got all the source for cPost included in this package.
The packing list is in the file cpostsrc.lst.  It's just plain
old C source, with #defined out stuff for AIX, OS/2 1.x, OS/2 2.x.

The code is intended to be straight ANSI C, with possible non-portable
stuff marked by #if defined() sections.

Here's what you should #define for particular platforms:

OS/2 1.x  #define OPSYS_OS2
OS/2 2.x  #define OPSYS_OS2V2
VM/CMS    #define OPSYS_CMS    - untested
others    don't define one of the above

AIX versions have been compiled without using any of the #define's.  DOS
versions should also compile fine, but as I don't have access to a DOS
compiler, I can no longer verify this myself.

The main operating system dependent stuff is in cPostUtl - the FileSpecAddXXX
series of functions.  If you need to modify this code, I would suggest
adding a new #if defined() section in there for the new platform, just
like the others.  Nice and neat.
